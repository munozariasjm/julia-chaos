# Chaos and Complex Dynamics with Julia
---

### By: Jose M Munoz


This repository aims to provide a collection of notes with Julia code for the study of chaos and complex dynamics. This should help anybody interested in the subject to get started with Julia and to learn about the subject. and people who would like to follow the notes of the great course and book on the topic [*Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*](https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering), by Steven Strogatz.

All of entries were also posted on this blog: [https://munozariasjm.github.io/blog/tag/complex-systems/](https://munozariasjm.github.io/blog/tag/complex-systems/)

The code is organized in the following way:

* `entries/` contains the notes in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which are organized in folders according to the topics they cover: one dimensional flows, two dimensional systems, and fractals with maps.
* `src/` contains the source code for a couple of the Julia functions used in the notebooks.
